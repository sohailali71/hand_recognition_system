Gestures are the actions that convey a meaningful message

Computer vision is being widely used for gesture detection 
and classification, and various approaches have been proposed 
to support simple applications. Here in this project, I have 
captured the live hand gesture using the webcam, 
say showing numbers, closed fist, and then go through the 
recognition process and classify the result.

STEPS INVOLVED :-
1) Pre processing
2) Segmentation
3) Contour Extraction
4) Convex hull
5) Convex defects
6) Count the number of fingers
